    "### **1️⃣ What is `TypedDict`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Python, a **dictionary** is a collection of key-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person = {\"name\": \"Deepak\", \"age\": 21}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python normally **does not care** what keys or value types you use, so you could accidentally write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person = {\"name\": \"Deepak\", \"age\": \"twenty-one\"}  # age should be int, but we used str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TypedDict** lets you **define the structure** of a dictionary in advance:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Which keys must exist.\n",
    "  * What type of value each key should have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import TypedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person(TypedDict):\n",
    "    name: str\n",
    "    age: int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p: Person = {\"name\": \"Deepak\", \"age\": 21}  # ✅ Correct\n",
    "p2: Person = {\"name\": \"Deepak\"}            # ❌ Missing 'age'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚠️ Important Note: `TypedDict` **does NOT enforce types at runtime**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is **dynamically typed**, so `TypedDict` only provides **type hints** for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Editors like VS Code\n",
    "  * Static type checkers like `mypy`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p3: Person = {\"name\": \"Deepak\", \"age\": \"twenty-one\"}  # ❌ Wrong type for 'age'\n",
    "print(p3)  # This will STILL RUN in Python! ❌\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `TypedDict` **does not automatically validate** the values at runtime.\n",
    "  * It is **mainly for static type checking and developer guidance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want runtime validation, you need **additional tools**, e.g., `pydantic` or manually checking types.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ Why use `TypedDict` in LangChain?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* LangChain wants **structured output from AI**. AI can return anything: free text, JSON, etc.\n",
    "* Using `TypedDict` tells LangChain **what keys and types the output should have**.\n",
    "* LangChain can then try to **validate and structure AI responses**, so your program can safely access fields like `summary` and `sentiment`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ Note: Even with `TypedDict`, if the AI returns wrong types, Python itself won’t throw an error unless LangChain has internal runtime checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3️⃣ How `TypedDict` works with LangChain**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a dictionary structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ReviewRequest(TypedDict):\n",
    "    summary: str\n",
    "    sentiment: str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tell LangChain to **produce output in this structure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "strctured_model = model.with_structured_output(ReviewRequest)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When you ask a question:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = strctured_model.invoke(\"what is machine learning in easy words\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* LangChain will **try to format AI output** according to `ReviewRequest`.\n",
    "* Example output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{'summary': 'Machine learning is teaching computers to learn from data.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ You can now safely access:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(result['summary'])\n",
    "print(result['sentiment'])\n",

The battery life is truly a game-changer; it easily lasts 10 days, which is much better than the competition. The health tracking is also incredibly accurate, especially the sleep monitoring. However, I have two minor gripes. Firstly, the companion mobile app is buggy and frequently crashes when syncing data. Secondly, the design, while durable, is a bit too bulky for smaller wrists. I'd definitely recommend it for its core functionality and longevity. - Review by Sarah M\"\"\")"
